# Developer Certificate Of Origin Template

If your project is *Visible Source* and you want to use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to manage contributions, you can use this template to create a `DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_OF_ORIGIN.md` file in your repository.

### What is a DCO?

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

It also ensures for closed source/visible source projects, any contributions' ownership is transferred to the project owner to prevent future licensing issues.

## The Template

Make sure to replace `<author>` with your username (and real name if you want to) - for example `@<author>`.

```txt
Developer Certificate of Origin

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this document, but changing it is not allowed unless you are the owner of this project: <author>

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
have the right to submit it under the "All Rights Reserved" status
of this repository and I hereby assign all rights, title, and interest
in the contribution to <author>; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate license and I
have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
whether created in whole or in part by me, and I hereby assign all rights,
title, and interest in the contribution to <author>; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
person who certified (a), (b), or (c) and I have not modified it,
and I hereby assign all rights, title, and interest in the contribution
to <author>.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
this project's "All Rights Reserved" status.
```

## Multi-Owner Projects

Please note that if your project has multiple owners, you must specify each owner, or decide on a lead owner who will be responsible for managing contributions and legally have ownership of the contributions.
